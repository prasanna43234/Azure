Network Security Groups (NSGs) in Azure

**Definition**:  
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are a critical security feature in Azure that acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources within a virtual network (VNet). 
NSGs are used to enforce and define security rules at both the subnet and network interface level.

Key Components

1. Rules:  
   Each NSG contains security rules that specify:
   - Source: The origin of the traffic (e.g., IP address or Azure resource).
   - Destination: The target of the traffic (e.g., a subnet or network interface).
   - Protocol: TCP, UDP, or Any.
   - Port Range: Specifies the port(s) affected.
   - Direction: 
     - Inbound: Traffic coming into the resource.
     - Outbound: Traffic leaving the resource.
   - Priority: A number between 100 and 4096 to determine rule precedence (lower numbers are processed first).
   - Action: Allow or Deny.

2. Default Rules:  
   NSGs come with predefined default rules, such as:
   - Allow traffic within the VNet.
   - Allow Azure load balancer traffic.
   - Deny all traffic by default at the end.

3. Scope of Application:  
   NSGs can be applied to:
   - Subnets: Rules apply to all resources within the subnet.
   - Network Interfaces (NICs): Rules apply only to the specific resource attached to the NIC.

### How NSGs Work

1. Traffic Evaluation:  
   When traffic enters or exits a resource:
   - The NSG evaluates it against all applicable rules in order of priority.
   - The first matching rule determines whether the traffic is allowed or denied.

2. Association:  
   You can associate an NSG with:
   - A subnet to secure all resources in the subnet.
   - A network interface to apply rules to a specific VM or resource.

3. Multi-Level Application:  
   When both subnet-level and NIC-level NSGs are applied:
   - Inbound traffic must pass both the subnet and NIC-level NSG rules to be allowed.
   - Outbound traffic must pass both the NIC and subnet-level NSG rules.

Use Cases

1. Restricting Access:  
   Allow access to specific ports (e.g., SSH on port 22) only from trusted IP addresses.

2. Segmentation:  
   Limit traffic between different subnets within the same VNet for improved isolation.

3. Regulatory Compliance:  
   Define and enforce strict rules to meet organizational or industry security standards.

4. Traffic Monitoring:  
   NSG flow logs can be enabled to analyze traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues.

Best Practices

1. Least Privilege Principle:  
   Allow only the necessary traffic to minimize the attack surface.

2. Log and Monitor:  
   Enable NSG flow logs in Azure Monitor to analyze traffic and identify anomalies.

3. Organize Rules:  
   Use descriptive names and consistent priorities to maintain readability and manageability.

4. Avoid Broad Rules:  
   Avoid rules like "Allow all traffic" unless absolutely necessary for troubleshooting.

5. Use Application Security Groups (ASGs):  
   Combine NSGs with ASGs to group resources logically and simplify rule management.

Conclusion

Network Security Groups in Azure are an essential tool for controlling and securing network traffic. 
By defining granular security rules, NSGs help ensure that resources in Azure are protected from unauthorized access while still allowing necessary communication.
