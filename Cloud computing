Cloud computing is accessing computing resources like servers, storage, and software over the internet. 
It allows you to use resources on demand, pay only for what you use, and scale easily without owning physical hardware. 
Examples include hosting websites or using online apps like Gmail.

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  
Azure provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networks.  
- Example: Azure Virtual Machines  
- Use Case: Hosting websites, databases, or custom applications.  
- Control: You manage the OS, middleware, runtime, and applications, while Azure manages the hardware and networking.  

PaaS (Platform as a Service)  
Azure provides a platform to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure.  
- Example: Azure App Service  
- Use Case: Building and deploying web and mobile apps.  
- Control: You manage applications and data, while Azure handles OS, runtime, and infrastructure.  

SaaS (Software as a Service)  
Azure delivers fully managed software applications that you can use directly.  
- Example: Microsoft 365, Azure DevOps  
- Use Case: Using email services, CRM tools, or DevOps platforms.  
- Control: You only use the software; Azure manages everything else.  

The choice between these depends on how much control and management responsibility you want.

Both AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure are highly popular, but AWS generally leads in market share, while Azure is growing rapidly, especially in enterprise adoption. Here's a quick comparison:

AWS

Launched earlier (2006), giving it a head start.
Largest global market share in cloud computing.
Popular with startups and tech companies.
Azure

Strong growth due to Microsoft's enterprise focus.
Integrates well with existing Microsoft tools like Office 365 and Windows Server.
Popular with enterprises and organizations already using Microsoft products.

Azure regions are geographic areas with multiple data centers. Availability zones are separate data centers within a region, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
54- regions
140-availability zones 

Azure region pairs are two geographically connected regions within the same area. They provide redundancy and disaster recovery by ensuring one region supports the other during outages. 
For example, East US is paired with West US.
