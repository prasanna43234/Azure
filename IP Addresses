An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier for devices connected to a network, used to identify and locate devices for communication.

Types of IP Addresses  
1. IPv4: Four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1), limited to 4.3 billion addresses.  
2. IPv6: Eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8::1), offering a much larger address space.  

Classes of IPv4 Addresses  
- Class A: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 (large networks).  
- Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (medium networks).  
- Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (small networks).  
- Class D: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (multicast).  
- Class E: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (experimental).  

Types Based on Accessibility  
- Public IP: Globally unique, internet-accessible (e.g., 8.8.8.8).  
- Private IP: Used in local networks, not internet-accessible (e.g., 192.168.1.1).  
- Dynamic IP: Temporarily assigned by a DHCP server, changes over time.  
- Static IP: Manually assigned, remains constant.  

Key Components  
- Network ID: Identifies the network.  
- Host ID: Identifies the device within the network.  
Example: In 192.168.1.1/24, 192.168.1 is the network ID, and 1 is the host ID.  

How It Works  
Devices send data using their IP address and the destination's IP address. Routers direct the data to the correct device or network, ensuring seamless communication.

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for efficiently allocating IP addresses and routing traffic. It replaces the old class-based system and is defined by a network address followed by a slash notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Key points:  
1. The slash (/) indicates the number of bits in the subnet mask.  
   - Example: /24 means the first 24 bits are for the network, and the rest are for hosts.  

2. CIDR helps in:  
   - Subnetting: Dividing a network into smaller segments.  
   - Supernetting: Combining networks to reduce routing entries.  

3. Benefits:  
   - Efficient IP address usage.  
   - Better route aggregation, reducing the size of routing tables.  

For example, 10.0.0.0/24 represents a network with 256 IPs, and 10.0.0.0/16 represents a network with 65,536 IPs.

In AWS class A wont be accessable 
class A - /8-16million vms
class B - /16-65000 devices
class C - /24- 254 
VNET is a regional resource .we can see this in every az.

By default vms have outbound internet access.we can access internet from vm 
private ip are free

In a 10.0.0.0/24 network, there are 256 IP addresses (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255), but only 251 are usable for devices. The remaining 5 are reserved for specific purposes:

1. Network address (1 address)  
   - 10.0.0.0: Identifies the network itself. This address cannot be assigned to any device.  

2. Broadcast address (1 address)  
   - 10.0.0.255: Used to send messages to all devices in the network.  

3. Default gateway (1 address, typically)  
   - Commonly 10.0.0.1: Used by the router or gateway for communication between the local network and external networks.  

4. Reserved for future use (2 addresses, typically by standards or network policies)  
   - Often allocated for management or special purposes depending on the setup, but they are not mandated by all configurations.  

In most cases, the three critical reserved addresses are 10.0.0.0, 10.0.0.255, and 10.0.0.1. For specific use cases, the network administrator may reserve others for specific roles or future expansion.
