Azure provides several ways to create a VM, including the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, and PowerShell. Here's an example walkthrough for creating a VM using the Azure Portal.

---

#### Step 1: Log in to the Azure Portal

#### Step 2: Start the VM Creation Process  
1. Navigate to Virtual Machines:  
   - Search for "Virtual Machines" in the top search bar.  
   - Click on "Virtual Machines" in the results.  

2. Click on Create:  
   - Select "Create" > "Azure virtual machine".

#### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings  
1. Subscription: Select your Azure subscription, such as Pay-As-You-Go.  
2. Resource Group: Choose an existing resource group or create a new one, such as `MyResourceGroup`.  
3. VM Name: Provide a name for your VM, such as `MyTestVM`.  
4. Region: Select the deployment region, such as East US.  
5. Availability Options: Choose from "No redundancy", "Availability set", or "Availability zones". For example, select "Availability zone".  
6. Image: Select the OS for your VM, such as Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS.  
7. VM Size: Pick a size, such as Standard_B2s with 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM.  
8. Authentication Type:  
   - Choose "SSH public key" or "Password".  
   - Set the username, such as `azureuser`, and password, such as `SecureP@ssw0rd!`.

#### Step 4: Configure Disk Options  
1. OS Disk Type: Choose disk performance, such as Standard SSD.  
2. Data Disks: Add extra disks if needed, such as a 64 GB additional disk.  
3. Encryption: Default encryption is enabled; configure advanced options if necessary.

#### Step 5: Configure Networking  
1. Virtual Network: Create or select a virtual network, such as `MyVNet`.  
2. Subnet: Create or choose a subnet, such as `MySubnet`.  
3. Public IP Address: Create a public IP for the VM, such as `MyPublicIP`.  
4. NIC Network Security Group (NSG):  
   - Choose "Basic" or "Advanced".  
   - For basic, allow selected ports like SSH (22).

#### Step 6: Configure Management Options  
1. Monitoring: Enable boot diagnostics, such as "Enable with managed storage".  
2. Auto-Shutdown: Enable and configure the shutdown time, such as 7:00 PM UTC.  
3. Backup: Enable Azure Backup if required.

#### Step 7: Configure Advanced Options  
- Use this for extensions, cloud-init, or custom scripts. Leave default unless specific requirements exist.  

---

#### Step 8: Configure Tags (Optional)  
- Add tags to categorize resources, such as Environment=Test or Owner=Lakshmi.  

---

#### Step 9: Review + Create  
1. Validation: Azure checks your settings for errors.  
2. Review: Confirm all configurations.  
3. Create: Click "Create" to start the provisioning process.  

---

#### Step 10: Access the VM  
1. Locate the VM: Go to "Virtual Machines" and select `MyTestVM`.  
2. Connect to the VM:  
   - Linux: Use SSH with `ssh azureuser@<Public-IP>`.  
   - Windows: Use RDP with the provided public IP.
